  "At the bachelor level, managers are looking for people who can work independently, have good com- munications and consulting skills, are organized, and are passionate about their work. ... New hires for such posi- tions at the bachelor level typically lack time management skills and project man- agement skills and are unable to manage multiple projects. They also lack knowl- edge in biology and statistics.  
  The responses for hiring at the master level were far more numerous and varied." General skills needed include those that are more interpretative and problem solv- ing, as well as personal traits, such as being independent, curious, and self-motivate . ...
  Not surprisingly, general skills needed at the PhD level include those skills necessary at the master level, as well as communi- cations skills, management skills, and the ability to help others.

  To successfully perform the duties of a bioinformatician, one must possess an array of bioinformatics skills: ability to manage, interpret, and analyze large data sets; broad knowledge of bioinformatics analysis methodologies; familiarity with functional genetic and genomic data; and expertise in common bioinformatics soft- ware packages and algorithms. A bioinformatician must apply statistics in contexts such as molecular biology, genomics, and population genetics. 
  Thus, a bioinformatician must have mastery of relevant statistical and mathematical mod- eling methods, including descriptive and inferential statistics, probability theory, differential equations and parameter esti- mation, graph theory, epidemiological data analysis, and programming and analysis of next generation sequencing data using software such as R and Bioconductor.
