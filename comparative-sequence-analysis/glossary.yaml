    info: conserved across all kingdoms. "Whereas bacteria and archaea encode either one or two sirtuins, eukaryotes encode several sirtuins in their genomes. In yeast, roundworms, and fruitflies, sir2 is the name of one of the sirtuin-type proteins (see table below).[11] Mammals possess seven sirtuins (SIRT1–7)"

        Rationale: I'm looking into this because wikipedia says it's one of the longest-lived trees in the world. If SIRT1/SIR2 are related to aging, then has anyone done any work to analyze if these trees do something unusual with their sirtuins?

          abstract: 
            The variety of lifespans of different organisms in nature is amazing. Although it is acknowledged that the longevity is determined by a complex interaction between hereditary and environmental factors, many questions about factors defining lifespan remain open. One of them concerns a wide range of lifespans of different organisms. The reason for the longevity of certain trees, which reaches a thousand years and exceeds the lifespan of most long living vertebrates by a huge margin is also not completely understood. Here we have discussed some distinguishing characteristics of plants, which may explain their remarkable longevity. Among them are the absence (or very low abundance) of intracellular inclusions composed of amyloidogenic proteins, the lack of certain groups of proteins prone to aggregate and form amyloids in animals, and the high level of compounds which inhibit protein aggregation and possess antiaging properties.Keywords: amyloidosis, protein aggregation, protein misfolding, longevity, lifespan, synucleins, neurodegeneration

          abstract:
            [Main conclusion] Carbonylation-ROS-dependent posttranslational modification of proteins-may be regarded as one of the important events in the process of ageing or senescence in plants. [Abstract] Ageing is the progressive process starting from seed development (plants) and birth (animals). The life-span of living organisms depends on many factors and stresses, which influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. The imbalance of their production and scavenging causes pathophysiological conditions that accelerate ageing. ROS modify nucleic acids, lipids, sugars and proteins. The level of carbonylated proteins can serve as an indicator of an oxidative cellular status. Several pathways of protein carbonylation, e.g. the conjugation with reactive carbonyl species, and/or a direct metal-catalysed oxidative attack on amino acids residues are known. Dysfunctional carbonylated proteins are more prone to degradation or form aggregates when the proteolytic machinery is inhibited, as observed in ageing. Protein carbonylation may contribute to formation of organelle-specific signal and to the control of protein quality. Carbonylated proteins are formed during the whole plant life; nevertheless, accelerated ageing stimulates the accumulation of carbonyl derivatives. In the medicine-related literature, concerned ageing and ROS-mediated protein modifications, this topic is extensively analysed, in comparison to the plant science. In plant science, ageing and senescence are considered to describe slightly different processes (physiological events). However, senescence (Latin: senēscere) means “to grow old”. This review describes the correlation of protein carbonylation level to ageing or/and senescence in plants. Comparing data from the area of plant and animal research, it is assumed that some basic mechanism of time-dependent alterations in the cellular biochemical processes are common and the protein carbonylation is one of the important causes of ageing. Keywords: Carbonyl groups, Posttranslational protein modification, ROS, Senescence
          comment: approaches longevity questions based on carbonylation of xyz.
