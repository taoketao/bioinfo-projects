Evolutionary Conservation Analysis of the SIRT1 Longevity Protein.


This is basic explorations with the data that underpin bioinformatics tasks.
For a weekend project, I'm getting familiar with the data files & formats,
some basic tools, and ways to analyze and manipulate the data.

As a toy task, I'm looking at comparative genomics and maybe transcriptomics
of a gene with homologs across model species that is implicated in aging-
related diseases, the SIRT1 / SIR2 genes.
