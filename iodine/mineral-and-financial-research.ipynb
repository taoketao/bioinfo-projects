    "- What is its valuation and capacity? Does its value fluctuate?\n",
    "- What are the approximate untapped sources of it, eg ppm coastal briny waters?\n",
    "- How much biomass is required to harvest 1 unit of iodine per day?\n",

    "    Industrial commodity pricing reflects the fluctuating costs of raw materials (metals, energy, agricultural goods) driven by supply/demand, economic growth, and policy, tracked via indices like the BLS Producer Price Index (PPI) or World Bank data, impacting production costs and signaling broader inflation trends for businesses and economists. Key factors influencing these prices include energy costs, global demand, supply chain issues, and currency fluctuations, with recent trends showing overall easing prices but volatility in specific sectors like metals. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \n",
    "Key Indicators & Data Sources \n",
    "\n",
    "• BLS Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, a key gauge of inflation. \n",
    "• World Bank Commodity Markets: Provides global price indices for energy, metals, food, and raw materials, with forecasts. \n",
    "• Trading Economics: Offers live commodity prices (e.g., metals, agricultural goods) and forecasts. \n",
    "• FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data): Hosts various indices, including the Global Price of Industrial Materials index. [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  \n",
    "\n",
    "Factors Influencing Prices \n",
    "\n",
    "• Supply & Demand: Basic economic principle; high demand and low supply drive prices up. \n",
    "• Economic Growth: Strong global growth boosts demand for industrial materials, while slowdowns decrease it. \n",
    "• Energy Costs: Oil, natural gas, and coal significantly impact production and transport costs for other commodities. \n",
    "• Policy & Geopolitics: Trade policies, geopolitical events, and central bank actions can disrupt supply chains and prices. \n",
    "• Currency Exchange Rates: Affect the cost of globally traded commodities. [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]  \n",
    "\n",
    "How It's Used \n",
    "\n",
    "• For Businesses: To understand input costs, forecast future expenses, and inform pricing strategies (e.g., value-based pricing). \n",
    "• For Economists & Investors: As leading indicators for inflation (PPI) and economic health, influencing monetary policy decisions and investment strategies. [2, 3, 4, 11, 12]  \n",
    "\n",
    "Current Trends (as of late 2025/early 2026) \n",
    "\n",
    "• Global commodity prices are generally projected to fall, reaching multi-year lows due to weak growth and surplus. \n",
    "• Energy and food indices have shown recent easing, though metals like copper and nickel have seen price increases. [3, 6]  \n",
