Which phyla and species do we observe iodine hormone thyroxine and  triiodothyronine? Do fish use them or related iodine hormones? Plants? Bacteria?




This is a deep and interesting question because **iodine-based hormones predate vertebrates**, but **canonical thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)** are actually restricted to a narrower slice of life than many people assume.

Below is a **phylogeny-aware breakdown**, moving from bacteria → plants → invertebrates → vertebrates, and distinguishing **true T3/T4 usage** from **related iodine chemistry**.

---

## 1. Vertebrates: canonical T4/T3 endocrine systems

### Phylum: **Chordata**

This is where **classical thyroid hormones** clearly exist as hormones with receptors and feedback loops.

### Fish

Yes — **all vertebrates, including fish, use T4 and T3**.

* Jawless fish (lampreys, hagfish): thyroid-like function
* Cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays): T4/T3
* Bony fish (teleosts): well-studied T4/T3 roles

Functions in fish:

* Metamorphosis (e.g., flatfish, salmon smoltification)
* Growth and development
* Metabolism
* Seasonal and environmental adaptation

Fish often:

* Produce more **T4**, convert locally to **T3** via deiodinases
* Are highly sensitive to environmental iodine availability

➡️ **Conclusion:** Fish use true thyroxine and triiodothyronine.

---

### Amphibians

Classic example:

* **T3 drives tadpole → frog metamorphosis**
* One of the strongest known thyroid hormone–dependent processes

---

### Reptiles, birds, mammals

* Canonical thyroid gland
* T4/T3 + nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRα, TRβ)
* Hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis

➡️ **Fully conserved vertebrate system**

---

## 2. Invertebrates: partial, controversial, or analog systems

### Chordate invertebrates (key evolutionary bridge)

#### Urochordates (tunicates, sea squirts)

* Produce **iodinated tyrosines**
* Have **thyroid hormone–like signaling**
* Endostyle (iodine-concentrating organ) is homologous to the vertebrate thyroid

Some tunicates:

* Contain T4 and T3 or very close analogs
* Use them in metamorphosis

➡️ **Closest non-vertebrate relatives with TH-like biology**

---

#### Cephalochordates (lancelets, *Branchiostoma*)

* Iodine metabolism
* Thyroid hormone receptor–like genes
* Use iodinated compounds in development

But:

* Often rely more on **TRIAC-like** or alternative iodothyronines rather than canonical T3

---

### Other invertebrates (arthropods, mollusks, annelids)

This is where things diverge.

* **No confirmed endogenous T3/T4 endocrine system**
* Some species absorb or respond to vertebrate T3/T4 experimentally
* Effects may occur via:

  * Non-specific nuclear receptors
  * Mitochondrial effects
  * Oxidative stress pathways

Examples:

* Mollusks (snails, bivalves): iodinated compounds present, unclear hormone role
* Arthropods (insects): development controlled by **ecdysteroids**, not thyroid hormones

➡️ Any T3/T4 effects here are **non-canonical and likely incidental**, not true hormones.

---

## 3. Plants: no thyroid hormones, but iodine chemistry exists

Plants **do not produce or use T3 or T4 as hormones**.

However:

### What plants *do* do

* Absorb iodine from soil
* Incorporate iodine into organic molecules
* Produce **iodinated tyrosines** under some conditions
* Use iodine as:

  * Antioxidant
  * Stress-response modulator
  * Possibly micronutrient (still debated)

Some plants contain:

* Trace iodotyrosines
* Occasionally T4/T3 when grown in iodine-rich environments
  → generally interpreted as **passive uptake**, not biosynthesis

Plants lack:

* Thyroid hormone receptors
* Deiodinase enzymes
* TH-regulated gene networks

➡️ **No thyroid hormone signaling in plants**

---

## 4. Bacteria and archaea: iodine without hormones

### Bacteria

* Do **not** synthesize T3 or T4 as signaling molecules
* No thyroid hormone receptors
* No endocrine-style signaling

But they *do*:

* Perform iodination reactions
* Produce iodinated organic compounds
* Use iodine in redox chemistry and antimicrobial defense

Some marine bacteria:

* Oxidize iodide → iodine
* Participate in global iodine cycling

Any T3/T4 detected in bacteria:

* Almost certainly absorbed from environment
* Or analytical contamination

---

### Archaea

* Similar story to bacteria
* No evidence of T3/T4 hormone systems

---

## 5. Why iodine hormones are mostly vertebrate

Key constraints:

1. **Iodine is rare and reactive**
2. T3/T4 require:

   * Tyrosine iodination
   * Controlled oxidative chemistry
   * Deiodinase enzymes
   * Nuclear receptors with precise DNA binding

This combination appears to have evolved:

* In **early chordates**
* From iodine-handling systems originally used for:

  * Antimicrobial defense
  * Redox regulation
  * Developmental timing

➡️ Thyroid hormones are likely an **exaptation** of older iodine chemistry.

## One-sentence takeaway

**True thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) are a vertebrate innovation rooted in chordate iodine biology; fish absolutely use them, tunicates show ancestral versions, while plants, bacteria, and most invertebrates do not use thyroid hormones despite widespread iodine chemistry.**

If you’d like, I can:

* Trace the **evolution of the thyroid gland from the endostyle**
* Compare **iodine hormones vs steroid hormones evolution**
* Discuss **environmental iodine, oceans, and early animal evolution**
* Tie this back to **soil microbes and iodine cycling**







Please survey iodine reactions and transporters used in salt-water algae. What do we know and what do we not know?







Here’s a **current, research-grounded survey of iodine handling in salt-water algae (macroalgae/seaweeds and microalgae)** — focusing on **what reactions are known**, **how transport works (or is hypothesized)**, and **where the major gaps in understanding remain**.

---

## 🧪 1) What chemical forms of iodine exist in seawater

* In marine surface waters the dominant dissolved species are **iodide (I⁻)** and **iodate (IO₃⁻)**.
* Iodide predominates near the surface and iodate becomes more abundant deeper in the water column. ([PMC][1])

These forms provide the substrate that algae encounter in the ocean.

---

## 🧬 2) Iodine accumulation by marine algae

### 🚩 Brown macroalgae (kelp, Laminariales)

Brown macroalgae (**Phaeophyceae**) — especially kelps like *Laminaria*, *Macrocystis*, *Saccharina* — are by far the **strongest iodine accumulators in the biosphere**, with tissue iodine up to ~30,000× seawater concentration. ([MDPI][2])

**Key features:**

* They take up iodine mainly as **iodide (I⁻)**. ([MDPI][3])
* A large fraction of internal iodine remains as **inorganic iodide** once accumulated. ([OUP Academic][4])
* Accumulated iodide plays a **physiological role as an antioxidant**, protecting cells from reactive oxygen species. ([PubMed][5])

### 🦠 Microalgae (phytoplankton)

Many marine microalgae (diatoms, haptophytes, etc.) also take up iodine, though generally at lower absolute concentrations than kelp. ([OceanRep][6])

For example, the haptophyte *Isochrysis sp.* accumulates iodide via a mechanism that **depends on iodide oxidation before uptake** — suggesting redox chemistry is integral to the process. ([PubMed][7])

---

## 🚚 3) Mechanisms of **iodine uptake and transport**

### 🧱 Brown algae

Brown algae do **not use a sodium/iodide symporter (NIS)** like vertebrates do. ([PubMed][7])

Instead, evidence suggests:

#### 🧪 A. Extracellular/Cell-surface oxidation

* **Haloperoxidases** (especially **vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases, VPOs**) on the cell surface or in the apoplast catalyze the oxidation of iodide (I⁻) to more lipophilic forms such as **hypoiodous acid (HOI)** or **I₂**. ([MDPI][2])
* These oxidized iodine species are more likely to interact with cell surfaces or membrane lipids and then be transported inside cells. ([OUP Academic][4])

#### 🧠 B. Iodine entry likely linked to redox chemistry

* Oxidized iodine forms (HOI, I₂) are **proposed** to cross the membrane or react with cell surface components to be internalized and then reduced back to iodide for storage. ([OUP Academic][4])

#### ✳ C. Saturation kinetics, but no specific “iodide pump” identified

* Iodine uptake in kelp shows **Michaelis–Menten-type saturation** (suggesting active or facilitated transport), yet the actual molecular transporter(s) have *not been identified* like in animal thyroid cells. ([OUP Academic][4])

---

### 🧬 Microalgae transport

* Studies in *Isochrysis sp.* show typical **iodide transport is not sensitive to vertebrate-type iodide transport inhibitors**, supporting a **distinct mechanism**. ([PubMed][7])

For many phytoplankton groups, the actual **iodide/iodate transporters remain unknown**, but uptake correlates with redox transformations at the cell surface.

---

## ⚙️ 4) Iodine transformations and reactions inside algae

### 🧪 Enzymatic oxidation

* **Haloperoxidases** (especially **vanadium haloperoxidases**) catalyze oxidation of I⁻ → HOI/I₂. ([OUP Academic][4])
* These are abundant in brown algae and appear to be **central to iodine handling** — for uptake, accumulation, and subsequent physiological responses. ([OUP Academic][4])

These oxidations are not hormone synthesis reactions like those in the vertebrate thyroid but are part of **halogen metabolism** that leads to iodine incorporation into organic molecules and volatile compounds.

---

### 🌊 Organo-iodine production

Algae produce **volatile iodinated compounds** such as iodomethane (CH₃I) that can be released into the atmosphere and have ecological and atmospheric implications. ([The Company of Biologists][8])

Some macroalgae and microalgae also contain **iodinated organic molecules**, including iodinated tyrosines, though their **significance and biosynthesis pathways are still poorly understood**. ([The Company of Biologists][8])

---

## ❓ 5) Major unknowns and ongoing research questions

Despite progress, several important aspects are **still poorly understood**:

### 🧬 A. Identity of specific transporters

* Unlike vertebrate NIS proteins, **no specific iodide transporter protein** has been definitively identified in algae. Research suggests a **facilitated diffusion or redox-linked uptake**, but the **molecular players are unknown**. ([OUP Academic][4])

### 🔄 B. Iodate reduction pathways

* Brown algae and some microalgae can take up iodate (IO₃⁻), but **how iodate is reduced to iodide at the cell surface** (which reductases are involved) is uncertain. ([MDPI][3])

### 🧪 C. Detailed intracellular speciation and fates

* Most internal iodine is inorganic (iodide), but **the role and pathways for organoiodine formation** — including incorporation into organic molecules — are not fully mapped. ([OUP Academic][4])

### ⚙️ D. Regulation, gene families, and environmental controls

* The **genetic regulation** of haloperoxidases and other enzymes under varying iodine and stress conditions is an active area of research. Recent transcriptomic studies in kelp suggest multiple haloperoxidase genes are involved, especially under stress. ([MDPI][9])

### 🤔 E. Extent in diverse algal clades

* Most knowledge comes from **brown macroalgae**; other groups (green algae, red algae, diverse phytoplankton) are less well characterized with respect to iodine uptake and metabolism. ([MDPI][3])

---

## 🧠 Summary — What we know

**Algae concentrate iodine primarily as iodide** through mechanisms tied to **oxidation by haloperoxidases** and membrane transport processes that are **distinct from animal NIS systems**. Iodide serves antioxidant roles and also participates in producing volatile and organic iodine compounds. Kelps dominate iodine biogeochemical cycling in coastal oceans. ([MDPI][2])

---

## 📍 What we *don’t* know

* The **exact transporter proteins** used by algae for iodide/iodate uptake remain unidentified.
* The detailed **enzyme pathways for iodate reduction and intracellular iodine handling** are largely hypothetical.
* The regulatory networks controlling iodine metabolism in different algal taxa are yet to be mapped.
