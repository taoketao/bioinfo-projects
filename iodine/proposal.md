Proposal for iodine

Iodine is an important and irreplacable element for industry [cite needed], healthcare [cite needed: world health essential medicines], and other applications such as forensics [cite needed]. In the past, iodine was harvested from kelp due to the seaweed's high iodine content [cite needed] but increasing demand has motivated a shift towards mineral extraction; the world's three predominant sources of Iodine today are calichine mines in Chile [cite needed], and briny water extraction in Oklahoma [cite needed] and Japan [cite needed]. For ecological sustainability, industry sustainability, and the economic security of an essential resource, we see a motivation to explore alternative, novel biotechnological methods for scalable iodine production.

Our hints come from several sources: one, that the thyroid has a very high specificity for iodine, so much so that radioactive iodine is a viable treatment for thyroid cancer [cite needed], and this has led to the identification of some of the mechanisms for highly selective iodine uptake [cite needed]. Two, kelp has already been identified as an iodine source [cite needed], and kelp is already an organism of study for various other research and industrial prospectives [cite needed]. Three, practically all organisms use require iodine for survival or use it for signalling, so across the kingdoms, there are biotechnologies waiting to be discovered. These hints have opened a possibility that we might re-engineer an organism -- whether kelp, protist, microorganism, or even animal source -- to extract iodine with high specificity from the environment and open a new avenue for industrial iodine production.

This proposal hopes to find support for the following research program. 
1. Survey, organize, and study the natural and pre-existing methods for iodine selectivity across kingdoms, species, and chemistry. If nee be, perform basic studies on viable organisms with high iodine content or utility to identify the ways the organism regulates, uptakes, and moves iodine.
2. Use biocomputational exploratory analysis to generate candidate synthetic biomolecules that can cause an accrual of iodine.
3. Use recombinant technology to engineer organisms, and select the most effective ones.
4. Survey natural and environmental sources of underutilized iodine and ways the top-performing organisms can plausibly render this iodine more available to extraction at a cost-effective rate, such as ambient ocean waters, soil, rivers, waste sites [cite needed].
5. Design a prototype engineering pipeline to test the organism's actual ability to accrue iodine, the method's sustainability, and cost to harvest the element. Analyze the technology economically and ecologically.
6. Build a biotechnology company to scale up the technology and sell the resulting iodine for profit, for resource independence, or even as a direct food additive.

This research process can apply to not just iodine but a variety of vitamins, minerals, or industrial precursors that are currently harvested from the environment in unsustainable ways. This workflow and the resulting industrial biotechnology could pave the way for new, less-extractive methods for mineral acquisition, the design of a natural multivitamin that can be mailed across the world in a petri dish, sunlight-driven energy-neutral mineral extraction, and a means to stimulate research into novel biomolecular mechanisms.
