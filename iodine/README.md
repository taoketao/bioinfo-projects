See proposal.md for the main info about the project. This repo is a catch-all for the project.

iodine-transporter-survey.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that documents research into a plausible molecular mechanism and target for re-engineering, the Na-I symporter. Also seeks to collect sequence information on other species, especially protist algae, and general molecular machinery that handles iodine.

mineral-and-financial-research.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that collects various market information on: iodine as a mineral commodity, resource security info for possible state contracts, and back-of-the-envelope calculations into the (micro)economic feasibility of this potential business.

Aquaculture.ipynb: aquaculture would be an essential link in this business. This notebook collects information about what's already been done regarding algae hatcheries: what species, hatchery techniques, bottleneck problems, and cultivation methods are being used and why and what are the scaling prospects.
