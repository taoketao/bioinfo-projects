A repo for collecting background research and quick analyses into the following project:

Project Iodine (placeholder name): an industrial research project based in ecology, bioengineering, and sustainable profit. Can we harvest iodine from seawater using microalgae that have been genetically modified to uptake and retain iodine, and form a company capable of building the technology infrastructure and streamlined enough to competitively sell the iodine? Can we do it sustainably and without harming the environment? And can we use it to launch a research frontier into algae-based biochemical extraction and fabrication?

proposal.md: for the main info about the project. This repo is a catch-all for the project.

iodine-transporter-survey.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that documents research into a plausible molecular mechanism and target for re-engineering, the Na-I symporter. Also seeks to collect sequence information on other species, especially protist algae, and general molecular machinery that handles iodine.

mineral-and-financial-research.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that collects various market information on: iodine as a mineral commodity, resource security info for possible state contracts, and back-of-the-envelope calculations into the (micro)economic feasibility of this potential business.

Aquaculture.ipynb: aquaculture would be an essential link in this business. This notebook collects information about what's already been done regarding algae hatcheries: what species, hatchery techniques, bottleneck problems, and cultivation methods are being used and why and what are the scaling prospects.

web-browsing-infodumps.md: assorted background research and info from wikipedia and papers to save, and my thoughts alongside it. Very informal and meant for CTRL-F searching. It would be nice to organize it.
