==Occurrence and production==
Iodine is the least abundant of the stable halogens, comprising only  
0.46&nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|parts per million]] of Earth's crustal 
rocks (compare: [[fluorine]]: 544&nbsp;ppm, [[chlorine]]: 126&nbsp;ppm,  
[[bromine]]: 2.5&nbsp;ppm) making it the 60th most abundant element.<ref  
name="Greenwood795">Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 795–796.</ref> Iodide  
minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for  
economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include [[Calcium  
iodate|lautarite]], Ca(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and dietzeite,  
7Ca(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·8CaCrO<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="Greenwood795"  
/> These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the [[caliche]],  
found in [[Chile]], whose main product is [[sodium nitrate]]. In total, they  
can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by mass.<ref  
name="Elzea">{{cite book |title = Industrial Minerals & Rocks: Commodities,  
Markets, and Uses |publisher = SME |date = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-87335-233-8

veditors = Kogel JE, Trivedi NC, Barker JM, Krukowski ST }}</ref> [[Sodium  
iodate]] is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by [[sodium  
bisulfite]]. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate,  
resulting in [[comproportionation]] to iodine, which may be filtered off.<ref  
name="Greenwood800" />

The caliche was the main source of iodine in the 19th century and continues  
to be important today, replacing [[kelp]] (which is no longer an economically  
viable source),<ref>{{cite journal |url =

Applications of Seaweed |date = 1862 |pages = 185–189}}</ref> but in the  
late 20th century [[brine]]s emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese  
[[Minami Kantō gas field]] east of [[Tokyo]] and the American [[Anadarko  
Basin]] gas field in northwest [[Oklahoma]] are the two largest such sources.  
The brine is hotter than 60&nbsp;°C from the depth of the source. The brine  
is first [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purified]] and acidified  
using [[sulfuric acid]], then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with  
chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be  
concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to [[Evaporation|evaporate]] the  
iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower, where [[sulfur dioxide]]  
reduces the iodine. The [[hydrogen iodide]] (HI) is reacted with chlorine to  
precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is  
packed.<ref name="Elzea" /><ref>{{cite journal |journal = Geochemical Journal

These sources ensure that Chile and Japan are the largest producers of iodine  
today.<ref name="Greenwood795" /> The companies [[Sociedad Química y  
Minera]] (SQM) and [[Cosayach]] lead iodine mining in Chile.<ref>{{Cite news

Alternatively, the brine may be treated with [[silver nitrate]] to  
precipitate out iodine as [[silver iodide]], which is then decomposed by  
reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of [[iron(II)  
iodide]]. The iodine is then liberated by displacement with [[chlorine]].<ref

extraction sites.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Autoridades monitorean evento que

==Applications==
About half of all produced iodine goes into various [[Organoiodine  
chemistry|organoiodine compounds]], another 15% remains as the pure element,  
another 15% is used to form [[potassium iodide]], and another 15% for other  
[[Iodine compounds|inorganic iodine compounds]].<ref name="Greenwood800" />  
Among the major uses of iodine compounds are [[Catalysis|catalysts]], animal  
feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical,  
sanitation (from [[tincture of iodine]]), and photography; minor uses include  
[[Smog tower|smog inhibition]], [[cloud seeding]], and various uses in  
[[analytical chemistry]].<ref name="Greenwood800" />

===X-ray imaging===
As an element with high [[electron density]] and atomic number, iodine  
efficiently absorbs X-rays.  X-ray [[Radiocontrast agent|radiocontrast]]  
agents is the top application for iodine.<ref name="Ullmann"/>  In this  
application, Organoiodine compounds are injected intravenously. This  
application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as  
[[angiography]] and [[CT scan]]ning. At present, all water-soluble  
radiocontrast agents rely on [[Iodinated contrast|iodine-containing compounds]].

Iodine absorbs X-rays with energies less than 33.3&nbsp;keV due to the  
[[photoelectric effect]] of the innermost electrons.<ref>{{cite book |

AbstractHigh iodine concentrations are thought to be toxic to algal growth.  
However, in this study, among tested 10 algae, 6 species (Bellerochea sp.,  
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Isochrysis galbana,  
Skeletonema costatum, Tetraselmis sp.) exhibited high iodine tolerance and 2  
species showed positive growth responses (Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa  
oceanica). On the other hand, growth of Chlorella kessleri and Chaetoceros  
sociale were strongly inhibited. Interestingly, the effect of iodine differed  
among algal species and between the molecular forms of iodine, namely iodide  
(I−) or iodate (IO3−) ions. Neutron activation analysis indicates that E.  
huxleyi intracellularly accumulated more iodine when grown in KIO3 than when  
grown in KI. Such high intracellular iodine accumulation may stimulate the  
growth. Moreover, E. huxleyi accumulated ca.10 times more iodine than that  
found in seawater, suggesting that microalgae can be used in iodine-related  
industries for extracting iodine from seawater and iodine-containing wastewater.

- abstract: The term microalgae describes 8 of the 11 common divisions of  
  single cell or colonial plants, the remaining three are macroalgae. The  
  inconspicuous microalgae serve as the primary food resource for higher  
  trophic levels in many ecosystems including lakes, salt marshes, oceans, and  
  submersed vascular plants. This chapter discusses the mineral compositions of  
  various algal groups and the effects of mineral deficiencies and mineral  
  accumulation in the microalgal groups. Minerals constitute the inorganic  
  portion of animal diets. Minerals considered essential for animal life are  
  divided into two general categories based upon level of requirement:  
  macronutrients and micronutrients. This chapter discusses the macronutrients  
  and the micronutrients that support the growth of various microalgae. Also  
  discussed are the “algal blooms”—dense accumulations of microalgae  
  above baseline levels resulting in monotypic aggregates, which may be  
  beneficial in some cases and toxic in some others. Other topics discussed are  
  bioaccumulation and bioremediation. Microalgae can effectively remove many  
  heavy metals from freshwater and marine environments via bioaccumulation in  
  living cells and binding to cell particulates after senescence.  
  Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms (intrinsic or extrinsic) to  
  remove pollutants from naturally occurring waters or anthropogenic waste streams.

"Via the thyroid hormones, iodine has a nutritional relationship with selenium. A family of selenium-dependent enzymes called deiodinases converts T4 to T3 (the active hormone) by removing an iodine atom from the outer tyrosine ring. " [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_in_biology)

"Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral,[114] sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals,[115] but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil).[116] The selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the range of 13–20 mg.[117]" [Locoweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locoweed)

The "organification of iodine", the incorporation of iodine into thyroglobulin for the production of thyroid hormone, is nonspecific; that is, there is no TPO-bound intermediate, but iodination occurs via reactive iodine species released from TPO. Ascidians (tunicates or sea squirts) and amphioxus, which are close invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, have a primitive homolog of the thyroid known as the [endostyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endostyle). They do not have a thyroglobulin gene that produce a protein intended specifically for making thyroxine, but do produce thyroxine. Presumably they simply rely on the nonspecific action.[4 == Kessler J, Obinger C, Eales G (Jul 2008). "Factors influencing the study of peroxidase-generated iodine species and implications for thyroglobulin synthesis". Thyroid. 18 (7): 769–74. doi:10.1089/thy.2007.0310. PMID 18631006.]

Previous research has concluded the presence of an iodination center in some Zone 5 cells, which contain a multitude of substances. Contradictory to that study, other studies have instead pointed toward Zone 7 as the iodination center, whereas other studies have leaned toward the iodine center in Zone 8. The reason for the multitude of studies garnering different results could be the trapping of iodine in the more ciliated zones, instead of the trapping and breakdown of iodine materials. The presence of iodine collection and breakdown promoted the function of the endostyle as a precursor to the thyroid."

Decreasingly related to iodine transport:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_yeast =>
Inorganic selenium-containing ions enter the cell using special transporter proteins.[citation needed] Inside of the yeast cell, the selenium is reduced to selenide.[6] Yeast lacks the machinery for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, unlike mammals.[7] It appears that yeast produce organoselenium compounds using promiscuous enzymes that do not effectively distinguish between selenium and sulfur.  ...  The selenium accumulator plant Astragalus bisulcatus has a more selective version of the cystine-tRNA ligase that reduces the chances of misincorporation of selenocystine when put in yeast. This genetic modification is, however, not expected to be used in selenium yeast as a food ingredient, but for use in the production of designer proteins in biotechnology.[9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_in_biology =>
Indicator plants. Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are Astragalus species (including some locoweeds), prince's plume (Stanleya sp.), woody asters (Xylorhiza sp.), and false goldenweed (Oonopsis sp.)[50]

Starch is also useful in detecting the enzyme amylase, which breaks down starch into sugars. Many bacteria like Bacillus subtilis can produce such an enzyme to help scientists identify unknown bacterial samples – the starch–iodine test is one of many tests needed to identify the exact bacterium.[13] The positive test for bacteria that has starch hydrolysis capabilities (able to produce amylase) is the presence of a yellow zone around a colony when iodine is added to detect starch.[14]

Homologous networks in eukaryotes: Spores form a part of the life cycles of a diverse range of organisms such as many bacteria, plants, algae, fungi and some protozoa. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kingdom Fungi), the set of early genes activating sporulation is induced by Ime1 (Inducer of Meiosis 1) and a regulator of middle genes is Ndt80p.[4] Similarly, in Dictyostelium discoideum (slime mold), SDF-2 and cytokinins are secreted during late development to trigger signal transduction pathways that lead to an increase in the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, which triggers rapid encapsulation as well as ensuring spore dormancy.[5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones
Little is known about intracellular kinetics of thyroid hormones. However, recently it could be demonstrated that the [crystallin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallin) [CRYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRYM) binds 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine in vivo.[63] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_peroxidase
The "organification of iodine", the incorporation of iodine into thyroglobulin for the production of thyroid hormone, is nonspecific; that is, there is no TPO-bound intermediate, but iodination occurs via reactive iodine species released from TPO. Ascidians (tunicates or sea squirts) and amphioxus, which are close invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, have a primitive homolog of the thyroid known as the endostyle. They do not have a thyroglobulin gene that produce a protein intended specifically for making thyroxine, but do produce thyroxine. Presumably they simply rely on the nonspecific action.[4] 

google ai: "Do genetic codes have introns/etc that guide a developing protein to the right destination, such as which side of a membrane?" =>
Genetic codes do not use introns to directly guide a fully formed protein to its destination. Introns are non-coding segments that are spliced (cut) out of the RNA before translation, so they do not directly code for the targeting information in the final protein. [1, 2, 3]  
However, the genetic sequence (exons) does contain special "address labels"—short amino acid sequences or specific structures—that guide the developing protein to the right cellular destination. [4, 5]  
Here is how the system actually works: 
1. The Real "Address Labels" (Signal Sequences) 
Proteins are directed to their correct locations (such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or specific sides of a membrane) by specialized amino acid sequences. 

• ER Targeting: A sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at the beginning (N-terminus) of the protein is recognized by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which brings the protein-ribosome complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
• Membrane Side (Topology): The specific orientation (which side of the membrane) is determined by "start-transfer" or "stop-transfer" sequences within the protein. These sequences act as anchors that determine if the protein passes through the membrane or stays embedded in it. 
• Peroxisome/Organelle Targeting: A short sequence at the end (C-terminus) of the protein (e.g., SKL) acts as a tag for transport to organelles like peroxisomes. [6, 7, 8, 9]  

2. The Indirect Role of Introns/etc. 
While introns are removed, they play indirect roles in protein targeting and overall expression: 

• Alternative Splicing: Introns allow for alternative splicing, where different exons are joined together. This allows a single gene to create multiple versions of a protein with different destination tags. 
• mRNA Localization: Specific introns can influence where the messenger RNA (mRNA) is localized within the cell, which in turn influences where the protein is synthesized. 
• Expression Regulation: Certain introns near the start of a gene act as "accelerators" for gene expression, controlling how much protein is produced. [10, 13, 14, 15, 16]  

Summary Table 

| Feature [1, 5, 6, 10, 15] | Role in Protein Targeting  |
| --- | --- |
| Exons (Coding) | Contain "signal sequences" (address labels) that direct proteins to membranes or organelles.  |
| Introns (Non-coding) | Removed before protein formation, but affect mRNA localization and alternative splicing.  |
| Stop-transfer sequence | Anchors the protein in the membrane and determines orientation.  |

In summary, the instructions to guide a protein are embedded in the exon (coding) sequences of the DNA, not in the introns themselves. [17, 18, 19]
