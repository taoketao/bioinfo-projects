  lipid homeostasis, lipid storage organelles called lipid droplets
  "also made key discoveries of cellular mechanisms that prevent lipotoxic damage in cancer, such as the accumulation of **oxidatively damaged phospholipids** during a regulated cell death process called ferroptosis"
  aims: cancer
  Ferroptosis: 
  - occurs in mammals -> ... -> plants; elements appear in archaea, bacteria
  - a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of [lipid peroxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation)
  - ie, iodine would clip it?
  https://www.olzmannlab.com/


iodine: asides
  [iodine-in-biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_in_biology) Thyroid hormones are phylogenetically very old molecules which are synthesized by most multicellular organisms, and which even have some effect on unicellular organisms.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deiodinase
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium\_bromoperoxidase
  - Vanadium bromoperoxidases have been found in bacteria, fungi, marine macro algae (seaweeds), and marine microalgae (diatoms) which produce brominated organic compounds.[Moore RM, Webb M, Tokarczyk R, Wever R (15 September 1996). "Bromoperoxidase and iodoperoxidase enzymes and production of halogenated methanes in marine diatom cultures". Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans. 101 (C9): 20899–20908. Bibcode:1996JGR...10120899M. doi:10.1029/96JC01248.]
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide\_peroxidase
  - Bromo peroxidases of red and brown marine algae ([Rhodophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae)(ie, kelp) and [Phaeophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodophyta)) contain vanadate (vanadium bromoperoxidase). 
  - [img]: Bromoperoxidase dodekamer from Corallina pilulifera, an example of a vanadium bromoperoxidase ([PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank): [1UP8](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1UP8))
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid\_peroxidase
  - The "organification of iodine", the incorporation of iodine into [thyroglobulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin) for the production of thyroid hormone, is nonspecific; that is, there is no TPO-bound intermediate, but iodination occurs via reactive iodine species released from TPO.
    - thyroglobulin is a source of tyrosine which is iodated to make thyroid hormones. What I'm looking for, a globular holder of iodine, might be...
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine-binding\_globulin ... is closer, but it binds the hormone.
    - Maybe it makes sense to bind I, with radius smaller than phosphorus, to a cation globulin but where the cation-binding residues are replaced with anion-binding lysines.
        Oh right, radius(I) =/= radius(I-). Radius I- is 2.2, one of the largest. Br- close. K+ is vaguely close. 
        http://abulafia.mt.ic.ac.uk/shannon/radius.php?orderby=IR&dir=-1
        Yes, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_radius#Tables -> I- is the largest elemental ion of anything except hydrogen H- (206), followed Br-, Cl- (182, 167). Potassium K+ has 152, as does Gold Au+1. Sulfur S2- has radius 170, Oxygen 2- has 126, N3- 132 (crystal). Effective radii: I- Br- Cl- 220, 196, 181; S2- 184; phosphorus P3- effective 212. Okay yeah I- is huge. selenium...?
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase  <- a selenium peroxidaase



    good angles: 
    - compare Na-I symporter differences with Na-Br symporter.
    - compare vanadium bromoperoxidase with iodoperoxidase.

    future angle: vanadium bromoperoxidase uses similar mechanisms to the nitrogen-fixing vanadium nitrogenase in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azotobacter.
