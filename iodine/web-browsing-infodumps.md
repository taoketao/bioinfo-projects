==Occurrence and production==
Iodine is the least abundant of the stable halogens, comprising only  
0.46&nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|parts per million]] of Earth's crustal 
rocks (compare: [[fluorine]]: 544&nbsp;ppm, [[chlorine]]: 126&nbsp;ppm,  
[[bromine]]: 2.5&nbsp;ppm) making it the 60th most abundant element.<ref  
name="Greenwood795">Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 795–796.</ref> Iodide  
minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for  
economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include [[Calcium  
iodate|lautarite]], Ca(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and dietzeite,  
7Ca(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·8CaCrO<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="Greenwood795"  
/> These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the [[caliche]],  
found in [[Chile]], whose main product is [[sodium nitrate]]. In total, they  
can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by mass.<ref  
name="Elzea">{{cite book |title = Industrial Minerals & Rocks: Commodities,  
Markets, and Uses |publisher = SME |date = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-87335-233-8

veditors = Kogel JE, Trivedi NC, Barker JM, Krukowski ST }}</ref> [[Sodium  
iodate]] is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by [[sodium  
bisulfite]]. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate,  
resulting in [[comproportionation]] to iodine, which may be filtered off.<ref  
name="Greenwood800" />

The caliche was the main source of iodine in the 19th century and continues  
to be important today, replacing [[kelp]] (which is no longer an economically  
viable source),<ref>{{cite journal |url =

Applications of Seaweed |date = 1862 |pages = 185–189}}</ref> but in the  
late 20th century [[brine]]s emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese  
[[Minami Kantō gas field]] east of [[Tokyo]] and the American [[Anadarko  
Basin]] gas field in northwest [[Oklahoma]] are the two largest such sources.  
The brine is hotter than 60&nbsp;°C from the depth of the source. The brine  
is first [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purified]] and acidified  
using [[sulfuric acid]], then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with  
chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be  
concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to [[Evaporation|evaporate]] the  
iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower, where [[sulfur dioxide]]  
reduces the iodine. The [[hydrogen iodide]] (HI) is reacted with chlorine to  
precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is  
packed.<ref name="Elzea" /><ref>{{cite journal |journal = Geochemical Journal

These sources ensure that Chile and Japan are the largest producers of iodine  
today.<ref name="Greenwood795" /> The companies [[Sociedad Química y  
Minera]] (SQM) and [[Cosayach]] lead iodine mining in Chile.<ref>{{Cite news

Alternatively, the brine may be treated with [[silver nitrate]] to  
precipitate out iodine as [[silver iodide]], which is then decomposed by  
reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of [[iron(II)  
iodide]]. The iodine is then liberated by displacement with [[chlorine]].<ref

extraction sites.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Autoridades monitorean evento que

==Applications==
About half of all produced iodine goes into various [[Organoiodine  
chemistry|organoiodine compounds]], another 15% remains as the pure element,  
another 15% is used to form [[potassium iodide]], and another 15% for other  
[[Iodine compounds|inorganic iodine compounds]].<ref name="Greenwood800" />  
Among the major uses of iodine compounds are [[Catalysis|catalysts]], animal  
feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical,  
sanitation (from [[tincture of iodine]]), and photography; minor uses include  
[[Smog tower|smog inhibition]], [[cloud seeding]], and various uses in  
[[analytical chemistry]].<ref name="Greenwood800" />

===X-ray imaging===
As an element with high [[electron density]] and atomic number, iodine  
efficiently absorbs X-rays.  X-ray [[Radiocontrast agent|radiocontrast]]  
agents is the top application for iodine.<ref name="Ullmann"/>  In this  
application, Organoiodine compounds are injected intravenously. This  
application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as  
[[angiography]] and [[CT scan]]ning. At present, all water-soluble  
radiocontrast agents rely on [[Iodinated contrast|iodine-containing compounds]].

Iodine absorbs X-rays with energies less than 33.3&nbsp;keV due to the  
[[photoelectric effect]] of the innermost electrons.<ref>{{cite book |

Okay, looks like if we tryna take iodine and 'neutralize' it in the cell to  
render it both harmless and stored, it's good to attach it to tyrosine (or  
histidine), the phenolic amino acid.

AbstractHigh iodine concentrations are thought to be toxic to algal growth.  
However, in this study, among tested 10 algae, 6 species (Bellerochea sp.,  
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Isochrysis galbana,  
Skeletonema costatum, Tetraselmis sp.) exhibited high iodine tolerance and 2  
species showed positive growth responses (Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa  
oceanica). On the other hand, growth of Chlorella kessleri and Chaetoceros  
sociale were strongly inhibited. Interestingly, the effect of iodine differed  
among algal species and between the molecular forms of iodine, namely iodide  
(I−) or iodate (IO3−) ions. Neutron activation analysis indicates that E.  
huxleyi intracellularly accumulated more iodine when grown in KIO3 than when  
grown in KI. Such high intracellular iodine accumulation may stimulate the  
growth. Moreover, E. huxleyi accumulated ca.10 times more iodine than that  
found in seawater, suggesting that microalgae can be used in iodine-related  
industries for extracting iodine from seawater and iodine-containing wastewater.

- abstract: The term microalgae describes 8 of the 11 common divisions of  
  single cell or colonial plants, the remaining three are macroalgae. The  
  inconspicuous microalgae serve as the primary food resource for higher  
  trophic levels in many ecosystems including lakes, salt marshes, oceans, and  
  submersed vascular plants. This chapter discusses the mineral compositions of  
  various algal groups and the effects of mineral deficiencies and mineral  
  accumulation in the microalgal groups. Minerals constitute the inorganic  
  portion of animal diets. Minerals considered essential for animal life are  
  divided into two general categories based upon level of requirement:  
  macronutrients and micronutrients. This chapter discusses the macronutrients  
  and the micronutrients that support the growth of various microalgae. Also  
  discussed are the “algal blooms”—dense accumulations of microalgae  
  above baseline levels resulting in monotypic aggregates, which may be  
  beneficial in some cases and toxic in some others. Other topics discussed are  
  bioaccumulation and bioremediation. Microalgae can effectively remove many  
  heavy metals from freshwater and marine environments via bioaccumulation in  
  living cells and binding to cell particulates after senescence.  
  Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms (intrinsic or extrinsic) to  
  remove pollutants from naturally occurring waters or anthropogenic waste streams.
