	 ^ halophile, thrives in salt. "D. salina is responsible for most of the primary production in hypersaline environments worldwide."
	"From a first pilot plant for D. salina cultivation for β-carotene production established in the USSR in 1966, the commercial cultivation of D. salina for the production of β-carotene throughout the world is now one of the success stories of halophile biotechnology.[13][14][15] Different technologies are used, from low-tech extensive cultivation in lagoons to intensive cultivation at high cell densities under carefully controlled conditions."

GPT recommends, based on phylogenic thyroxine => iodine reactions and transporters in salt-water algae:  Brown macroalgae (Phaeophyceae) — especially kelps like Laminaria, Macrocystis, Saccharina — are by far the strongest iodine accumulators in the biosphere, with tissue iodine up to ~30,000× seawater concentration

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_fuel#Species  
	good list of species that were investigated as biofuel sources. "The preference for microalgae [over macroalgae] has come about due largely to their less complex structure, fast growth rates, and high oil-content (for some species)".  In algae, " The concentrations of phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and molybdenum (Mo), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si) and sulfur (S) concentrations were measured daily using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis'  Absolutely excellent article and guidepost.
